# Project architecture

## Structure
The program is build in four layers and packages implement those layers:

**mastermind.gui -> mastermind.gamelogic -> mastermind.domain -> mastermind.dao**

The gui package includes the graphic user interface which is programmed using JavaFx. Mastermind.gamelogic acts as a bridge between the user interface and the program logic (domain and dao). Domain-package has all the basic program logic and dao-package is responsible for saving data to databases and to local disk.

## The User Interface
### Views
* New Game Window
	* Creating a new player / log in
* Game Scene
	* Main game window
* Score Board
	* Shows the game statistics and scores
* Options
	* The player can choose how many guesses are allowed
* Game Over Window
	* Shows the final time
	* New Game, Close and Quit buttons
* Help
	* Game Instructions

The score board, options and game instructions are scenes that can be added to the primary stage. The new game and game over windows have their own stage. 

The **GameScene**-class is the main class of the GUI. 

The user interface is interacting with the GameLogic-class which is then sending tasks to other classes in the domain package. Besides that the gui is also interacting with UserService class for database functions and options class for setting new options. 

### The Program Logic

The **PlayerService**-class acts as a bridge between the dao-classes and the domain classes.  The **GUI** gives and receives information about players and game stats to/from the PlayerService-class. The GameLogic-class is in charge of the *codemakers* and the *codebreakers* tasks. GUI is divided into multiple classes, each handling their own scene, window or fuction.

### Saving data to database and local disk

The classes FilePlayerDao and FileGameDao in the package mastermind.dao are responsible for saving data to files and local disk. The dao classes are designed in the [Data Access Object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access_object) design pattern. The FilePlayerDao and FileGameDao implement the PlayerDao and GameDao interfaces and the program logic uses those interfaces. 

### Files
The program saves player and game data to separate files on the local disk. The file names are spesified in a config.properties file which is located in Mastermind/src/main/resources. Currently the file names are set to players.txt and games.txt.

Player data is saved in this format:
`name;best time;best score;amount of games won;`

The player attributes are separated by a semicolon.

Game data is saved in this format:
`player name;score;time;number of guesses`

Also here the game attributes are separated by a semicolon.

## The main functions in the program

### Creating a new player / log in

The program validates the player name by length. If the length is under three or longer than 15, an error message will show  up.

### Playing

The player can click on the code tiles to change to color (left or right click depending on the direction the player wants).
When the player is satisfied with the guess, he/she can press the accept button to get feedback. If there were blanks left in the guess, and error message will show up and no feedback will be given.

The following sequence diagram shows what happens when the player clicks the accept guess -button.

1) The guess is retrieved from the *board* and saved to String array. 
2) The program checks wheather the guess is valid (has no blanks in it).
3) GameLogic: Setting the guess and getting feedback
4) Set feedback pieces accordingly
5) Check if the game ends (no guesses left or code is broken)
6) If the game doesn't end, set active row to next and label texts accordingly

### Game Over

The game ends either when the player runs out of guesses or if he/she solves the code.

## Weaknesses in the program

The class and package structure could propably be still simplified and refactured. I had problems deciding how to delegate responsibilities between the gui, gamelogic, and some of the domain classes. 

I had some difficulties in the error handling. I got also feedback during the peer review about the multiple try/catch segments in the code. It should be refactored somehow but as of now I don't really have the clear picture how to do it in the correct way. I decided to leave it as it is for now. 

The PlayerDao and the GameDao classes have repetitive code and it could be refactored. 
The GameScene-class is quite big and it could be still split into smaller classes.
 

**Options:** 

It would be nice that the player could have more options to customize the game. For example allowing blanks or setting a time limit for each guess. Also a game difficulty setting would be nice. 

In the  **No guesses left** situation it would be nice to have an opportunity to see the right answer.
